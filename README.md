## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
<summary><b>Can I use multiple devices with the same vault?</b></summary>
Yes! Just install Dementor Sync on each device and use the exact same encryption password.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>What happens if I change my encryption password?</b></summary>
Changing your encryption password requires re-encrypting all your data. Use the "Change Encryption Password" option in settings, which will handle this process automatically.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Is Dementor Sync compatible with the official Obsidian Sync?</b></summary>
No, you should use either Dementor Sync or Obsidian Sync, but not both simultaneously for the same vault.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>What WebDAV providers are recommended?</b></summary>
We recommend Nextcloud (self-hosted or through a provider), pCloud, Box, or Yandex.Disk for their reliable WebDAV implementations.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>I'm having connection issues with Yandex.WebDAV, what should I do?</b></summary>
The plugin now features enhanced diagnostics for Yandex.WebDAV connections. Test your connection in settings and check the detailed error messages. Make sure you're using the correct URL (https://webdav.yandex.ru) and valid credentials.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Why am I getting path-related errors with WebDAV?</b></summary>
Different WebDAV servers handle paths differently. As of v1.0.1, the plugin automatically detects specific providers (like Yandex.WebDAV) and adjusts path handling accordingly.
</details>
