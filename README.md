## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
<summary><b>Can I use multiple devices with the same vault?</b></summary>
Yes! Just install Dementor Sync on each device and use the exact same encryption password.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>What happens if I change my encryption password?</b></summary>
Changing your encryption password requires re-encrypting all your data. Use the "Change Encryption Password" option in settings, which will handle this process automatically.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Is Dementor Sync compatible with the official Obsidian Sync?</b></summary>
No, you should use either Dementor Sync or Obsidian Sync, but not both simultaneously for the same vault.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Which storage provider should I choose?</b></summary>
It depends on your needs. WebDAV is widely supported and often simpler to configure, while S3 offers better scalability and may be more cost-effective for larger vaults. We recommend Nextcloud for WebDAV and MinIO or Ceph for S3.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can I switch between WebDAV and S3 storage?</b></summary>
Yes, but it requires re-syncing your vault. Export your vault first, change providers, then sync again.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>I'm having connection issues with S3, what should I do?</b></summary>
The plugin features enhanced diagnostics for S3 connections. Test your connection in settings and check the detailed error messages. Make sure you're using the correct endpoint URL, bucket name, and valid access/secret keys.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Do I need to use AWS S3 specifically?</b></summary>
No, any S3-compatible storage provider will work, including self-hosted options like MinIO or Ceph.
</details>
